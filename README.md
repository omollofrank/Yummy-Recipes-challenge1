# Yummy-Recipes-challenge1
An app for one to view, add, and delete recipes.
The app is made to help keep one's recipes which can be refered to in later times. With this app, one is able to capture recipes at any given time.
For people to access the app oit can be dowloaded from the App stores and they are good to go.
Now here is how the app works. Once it is downloaded, you will first have to sign up, thaat is if one doesn't have an account. For those wo already hve an account they will definitely head straight to log in. Once loggged in or signed up ypu will first write a recipe. Afterwards it is when you can view your recipes which gives you an option of either editing or deleting a recipe.
